# AskGender
This repository contains a simple Python script that prompts the user to input their gender. If the input is valid (either 'M' or 'F'), the program responds with a greeting. If the input is invalid, the user will be asked to try again.

## How it works:

1. The script asks the user to input their gender using the prompt `Qual seu sexo? [M/F]`.
2. If the user inputs an invalid value (anything other than 'M' or 'F'), it will ask them to try again.
3. If the input is 'M', the script will print "Seja bem-vindo" (Welcome).
4. If the input is 'F', the script will print "Seja bem-vinda" (Welcome).

## Example:

``Qual seu sexo? [M/F] M Seja bem-vindo``

## Requirements:

- Python 3.x

## Usage:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the script in your Python environment.
3. Input 'M' or 'F' when prompted for gender.
